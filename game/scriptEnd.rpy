    "Glen starts to shake beside you, at first as though with a chill, but ever and ever harsher, until they’re convulsing in place, body bending unnaturally."
    H "“Glen! GLEN!”"
    "You move to reach out to them, but find yourself rooted in place, vines grown over your ankles."
    "There are no thorns to bite into your flesh, but enough movement chafes them against your skin and causes it to itch and burn."

    "Their eyes catching the lantern and throwing a glare."
    "Their love for meat best when it’s extra bloody and the way their teeth can shred."
    H "“Well there’s nothing to be done about it, nothing that should. You are Glen, as you are, and someone we all treasure.”"
    "Glen’s gaze is far away, their mind cast adrift as well."
    "They look at the wall of your room, but are seeing much, much further beyond."
    G "“Some things… could be done. People could be made to reckon.”"
    "The forest. Without them saying, you know it’s of what they speak."
    H "“Those things— Those people— “"

    "Their face is set, their expression firm. Sure. Glen is always sure."

    "Glen is going to do this, without or without you. And no one should brave the forest alone."
    H "“Next week, when pa is making his run.”"
    G "“Today. Now. I packed us lunch. I fetched us water. Just say yes.”"
    "You suppose it was inevitable. So many end up in the forest."
    "It draws them like moths to the flame and still they stay, stubborn and sure. So sure that they belong in these hills."
    "Perhaps that’s just the order of things, perhaps this is part of the ecosystem, the food chain."
    "The forest sits above them all and the forest needs to feed."
    H "“Yes. Today. Now.”"
