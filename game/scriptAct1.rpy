    "Another clearing opened before them. You walk toward the center, looking for another path out."
    G "“Harper, someone’s coming!” Glen whispers, pulling your sleeve. Rustling interrupts the soft silence of the forest."
    H "“Did they follow us?” you whisper back, turning to the sound."
    "A dark figure emerges from the brush, staggering. Glen gasps."
    G "“Harper, I think they’re hurt!”"
    "It’s true. It’s a man, or something that looks like one. He’s covered in dirt, and can barely walk."
    L "“H...Help me, th...they’ll find me.”"
    G "“Should we hide him?” Glen asks you, getting straight to the point."
    L "“P-Please, they’re going to kill me.” His voice becomes hushed. You see he carries a bundle, something precious."
    "More rustling interrupts your thoughts. It’s louder this time. Violent. Your eyes dart to the knife at your belt."

            H "“In the bushes.” You ease him down into the shade of the bushes, while Glen pushes the dirt around with their boot, trying to hide the man’s footprints."

            G "“What are you going to do if you find him?” Glen asks."
            "They level their gazes on Glen, who you shoot a glare. You hadn’t said it was a “him”."
            Cr "They respond nonetheless. “We will reclaim what is ours.” Without another word, they return between the branches of the forest."
            G "Glen tugs at your sleeve, frozen until now. “We have to get out of here, Harper. C’mon, please.”"

    "It starts as a tinkling, a clatter of glass and jangle of charms. The sound is familiar to those who trade in wares, traveling the dirt roads to larger cities with the hope of a livelihood."
    "Harper and Glen know it well, always excited for the promise of something new, something never before seen drifting into their sphere."
    "The creak of wheels and heaving, humid groan of something strange signal an approach."
    "It's—"
    "There’s—"
    "He rounds a gnarly trunk, cart almost overturning, before tipping his gaze up and coming to a stop."
    M "“Aha! Oh my. Look at the heft of you two.”"
    "His gaze is more than assessing, it scores against your skin as the beady black flit from you to Glen and back again. "
    G "Glen steps to him, immediate, bouncing as she steps to his stock."
    G "“At us? At you! What a thing, what a wonderful, whimsical thing.”"
    "The merchant grins, teeth— oh the teeth."
    M "“Come, come and look. More I have, if your eye is for such things.”"
    "He stands aside, gestures his arms across the glowing bottles, stringed baubles, powders and liquids and… meats."

    "Glen’s eyes light up as they spot something you don’t, plunging their hands into the cart before reeling back with a yelp. Blood, bright and wet, seeps down a single finger, blackens, and breaks off."
    G "“What was that, what did you do?”"
    M "“An even trade! Your delight costs but a bit of blood. Good business, great business. Thank you!”"
    "The merchant takes a low bow and then snuffles as he straightens out, moving to retake the front of his cart and take to the road." 
    H "“Wait! Sir, you never told us the terms. This is unfair.”"
    "The merchant squints his eyes, sets his jaw, smacks his lips, once."
